      <h1>Welcome to Web developers</h1>
      <p>
        Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end
        developers, front-end developers, and full-stack developers. Some web
        developers also work as webmasters. Let’s take a closer look at each of
        these roles. Back-end web developers create the website’s structure,
        write code, and verify the code works. Their responsibilities also may
        include managing access points for others who need to manage a website’s
        content.
